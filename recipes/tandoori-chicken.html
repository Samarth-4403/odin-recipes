    <h3>Tandoori chicken is a flavorful Indian dish of marinated chicken cooked in a traditional clay oven. It is known for its vibrant color, bold spices, and smoky flavor.</h3>
    <p>To make tandoori chicken, start by marinating chicken pieces in a mixture of yogurt, spices, and lemon juice. The marinade typically includes ingredients such as turmeric, chili powder, cumin, ginger, garlic, and garam masala. Allow the chicken to marinate for at least a few hours or overnight for the flavors to develop. Next, preheat your oven to a high temperature or use a grill. Place the marinated chicken on a baking sheet or grill rack and cook until the chicken is cooked through and slightly charred on the edges. Serve the tandoori chicken hot, garnished with fresh cilantro and a squeeze of lemon juice. It is a delicious and aromatic dish that is perfect for sharing with family and friends.</p>
